# Bootstrap Demo
 from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/headers/

Using the Bootstrap 5 examples from their website Building my own
set for website starters. I wish they had these broken into separate than all on one page. I had
to pull the pieces apart to get what I need. But wasn't too hard. 

# MenuHeader - Adds a header/menu bar at the top of the page 

 Add a header with various website common menus, search field, login and signup menu

# Sidebar - Adds a sidebar menu

Expands the page with both the MenuHeader from above to include a menu sidebar
